          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Green Aura is the highest frequency that resonates with the
            vibrations of the heart. It is the leading energy that centers and
            aligns with unconditional love. People who have green emissions in
            their energy field are natural born healers. Healers with Green Aura
            channel their energy through their hands. I, Brian Rivera graduated
            from Swedish Institute College of Health Science. I am an innate
            healer discovered my passion and mission when my mother was
            diagnosed with Cancer. Since then, I have dedicated to all my
            patients especially suffering from Cancer, Arthritis, Broken bones,
            structural deformities, Depression, Anxiety, Parkinson’s Disease.
            Depending on the condition, I’ll recommend the best practice at
            Green Aura Spa.
